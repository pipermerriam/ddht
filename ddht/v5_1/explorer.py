    TODO: needs updating

    Return an async iterator (trio.abc.ReceiveChannel) which will find *all*
    nodes in the network, prioritizing the search towards nodes closest to
    `target`.

    The algorithm builds on `recursive_find_nodes` to quickly find the node in
    the network that is closest to the target.

    Then we work through the known nodes in order of proximity to the `target`.
    For each `node_id` we check the distance between it and its closest
    neighbors to determine the maximum bucket index we should query.  Since
    each knows the most about the neighborhood of the network it resides in, we
    only want to query the buckets up to and including the ones that include
    the closest neighbors.  We issue FIND_NODES queries until we encounter
    empty buckets.

    This function strikes a balance between focusing exploration on the
    `target` part of the network, and quickly returning results.  The initial
    results returned by this function might not be close to the target, but it
    should very quickly narrow in towards the target, after which it will
    slowly work away from the target.
